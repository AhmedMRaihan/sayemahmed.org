Dr Sayem Ahmed is working as a Research Fellow (Health Economist) at the Centre for Health Economics and Medicine Evaluation (CHEME), Bangor University, UK. He holds a PhD degree in health economics from Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Before joining CHEME, Dr Ahmed worked at the University of Glasgow in UK, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Vietnam, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in UK and icddr,b in Bangladesh. He was involved as consultant with the World Health Organization, The World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. {style="text-align: justify;"}

Ahmed’s research deals with estimating health economic burden and economic evaluation of new health technologies and interventions. In addition, Ahmed conducted research on health insurance, healthcare financing, universal health coverage, and health system efficiency in low- and middle-income countries. He teaches health economics and supervises MSc and PhD students. {style="text-align: justify;"}

Dr Ahmed is working on the RENAL-HF at CHEME, undertaking economic evaluations alongside clinical trials. This NIHR-funded program is developing and evaluating an artificial intelligence-based monitoring system that predicts the change in renal function in patients with heart failure. In this project, Dr Ahmed is conducting an economic evaluation using UK's large health datasets (e.g., Clinical Practice Research Datalink -CPRD, Hospital Episode Statistics -HES) and health economics modelling approach. This study will generate much-needed evidence to reduce kidney injury risk among heart failure patients.
