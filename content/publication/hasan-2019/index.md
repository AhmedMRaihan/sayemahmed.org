abstract: textlessptextgreaterDiabetes mellitus is rising disproportionately but is
  not frequently diagnosed until complications appear, which results in adverse health
  consequences. We estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes among adult diabetic
  patients and associated socioeconomic inequalities in Bangladesh. We used nationally
  representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2011
  data. Among patients with diabetes, we identified undiagnosed cases as having fasting
  plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, never having taken prescribed medicine and being told
  by health professionals. Among 938 patients with diabetes, 53.4% remained undiagnosed.
  The poorest (75.9%) and rural (59.0%) patients had significantly higher undiagnosed
  cases than the richest (36.0%) and urban (42.5%), respectively. Multiple logistic
  regression analysis revealed that the likelihood of being undiagnosed was lower
  among patients with age ≥ 70 years vs. 35–39 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =
  0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19, 0.64) and patients with higher education
  vs. no education (AOR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.21, 0.62). Conversely, a high level of physical
  activity and being in a poor socioeconomic quintile were associated with a higher
  risk of remaining undiagnosed for diabetes. The Concentration Index (C) also showed
  that undiagnosed diabetes was largely distributed among the socioeconomically worse-off
  group in Bangladesh (C = −0.35). Nationwide diabetes screening programs may reduce
  this problem in Bangladesh and other similar low-income settings.textless/ptextgreater
