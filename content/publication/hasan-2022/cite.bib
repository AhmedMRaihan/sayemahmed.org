 abstract = {BACKGROUND Financing healthcare through out-of-pocket (OOP) payment is a major barrier in accessing healthcare for the poor people. The Health Economics Unit (HEU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the government of Bangladesh has developed Shasthyo Suroksha Karmasuchi (SSK), a health protection scheme, with the aim of reducing OOP expenditure and improving access of the below-poverty-line (BPL) population to healthcare. The scheme started piloting in 2016 at Kalihati sub-district of Tangail District. Our objective was to assess healthcare utilization by the enrolled BPL population and to identify the factors those influencing their utilization of the scheme. METHOD A cross-sectional household survey was conducted from July to September 2018 in the piloting sub-district. A total of 806 households were surveyed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Information on illness and sources of healthcare service were captured for the last 90 days before the survey. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to determine the factors related to utilization of healthcare from the SSK scheme and other medically trained providers (MTPs) by the SSK members for both inpatient and outpatient care. RESULT A total of 781 (24.6%) people reported of suffering from illness of which 639 (81.8%) sought healthcare from any sources. About 8.0% (51 out of 639) of them sought healthcare from SSK scheme and 28.2% from other MTPs within 90 days preceding the survey. Households with knowledge about SSK scheme were more likely to utilize healthcare from the scheme and less likely to utilize healthcare from other MTPs. Non-BPL status and suffering from an accident/injury were significantly positively associated with utilization of healthcare from SSK scheme. CONCLUSION Among the BPL population, healthcare utilization from the SSK scheme was very low compared to that of other MTPs. Effective strategies should be in place for improving knowledge of BPL population on SSK scheme and the benefits package of the scheme should be updated as per the need of the target population. Such initiative can be instrumental in increasing utilization of the scheme and ultimately will reduce the barriers of OOP payment among BPL population for accessing healthcare.},
