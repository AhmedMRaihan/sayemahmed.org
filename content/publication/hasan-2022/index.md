abstract: 'BACKGROUND Financing healthcare through out-of-pocket (OOP) payment is a
  major barrier in accessing healthcare for the poor people. The Health Economics
  Unit (HEU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the government of Bangladesh
  has developed Shasthyo Suroksha Karmasuchi (SSK), a health protection scheme, with
  the aim of reducing OOP expenditure and improving access of the below-poverty-line
  (BPL) population to healthcare. The scheme started piloting in 2016 at Kalihati
  sub-district of Tangail District. Our objective was to assess healthcare utilization
  by the enrolled BPL population and to identify the factors those influencing their
  utilization of the scheme. METHOD A cross-sectional household survey was conducted
  from July to September 2018 in the piloting sub-district. A total of 806 households
  were surveyed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Information on illness and
  sources of healthcare service were captured for the last 90 days before the survey.
  Multiple logistic regression models were applied to determine the factors related
  to utilization of healthcare from the SSK scheme and other medically trained providers
  (MTPs) by the SSK members for both inpatient and outpatient care. RESULT A total
  of 781 (24.6%) people reported of suffering from illness of which 639 (81.8%) sought
  healthcare from any sources. About 8.0% (51 out of 639) of them sought healthcare
  from SSK scheme and 28.2% from other MTPs within 90 days preceding the survey. Households
  with knowledge about SSK scheme were more likely to utilize healthcare from the
  scheme and less likely to utilize healthcare from other MTPs. Non-BPL status and
  suffering from an accident/injury were significantly positively associated with
  utilization of healthcare from SSK scheme. CONCLUSION Among the BPL population,
  healthcare utilization from the SSK scheme was very low compared to that of other
  MTPs. Effective strategies should be in place for improving knowledge of BPL population
  on SSK scheme and the benefits package of the scheme should be updated as per the
  need of the target population. Such initiative can be instrumental in increasing
  utilization of the scheme and ultimately will reduce the barriers of OOP payment
  among BPL population for accessing healthcare.'
