abstract: BACKGROUND In recent years, developing countries like Bangladesh are facing
  a higher burden of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension as a result of
  demographic transition. Prevalence of hypertension is often studied in this setting.
  However, evidence on undiagnosed hypertension is not widely available in the existing
  literature. Therefore, the current study focuses on inequalities in the prevalence
  of undiagnosed hypertension in Bangladesh. METHODS A total of 8835 participants
  aged 35+ years were included in this study using nationally representative Bangladesh
  Demographic and Health Survey 2011 (BDHS). In the survey, systolic blood pressure
  (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of these participants were measured three
  times with approximately 10 minutes of an interval between each measurement. Any
  respondent with either SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg was considered as patient
  with hypertension as per the guidelines from American Heart Association. Among the
  participants, undiagnosed hypertension was defined as having SBP textgreater =140
  mmHg or DBP textgreater =90 mmHg and never taking prescribed medicine or being told
  by health professionals to lower/control blood pressure. Multiple logistic regression
  analysis was applied for identifying factors associated with undiagnosed hypertension.
  Further, socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension
  were estimated using Concentration Index (C). RESULTS We found 978 (59.9% of the
  total) were undiagnosed among 1685 hypertensive patients studied. Regression analysis
  showed individuals with being underweight, having poor socioeconomic conditions,
  and lower educational qualifications were more likely to have undiagnosed hypertension.
  A similar association between undiagnosed hypertension and socioeconomic quintiles
  was observed using concentration index (C = - 0.07). On the other hand, individuals
  from higher age group (50-64 or above), female sex, and Sylhet region were at lower
  risk of undiagnosed hypertension. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that a large proportion
  of the cases with hypertension are remained undiagnosed in Bangladesh, especially
  among the poor and low educated population. Screening and awareness building initiatives
  on hypertension should be taken for this group of population to reduce the burden
  of undiagnosed hypertension.
