abstract: Background Equity in access to and utilization of healthcare is an important
  goal for any health system and an essential prerequisite for achieving Universal
  Health Coverage for any country. Objectives This study investigated the extent to
  which health benefits are distributed across socioeconomic groups; and how different
  types of providers contribute to inequity in health benefits of Bangladesh. Methodology
  The distribution of health benefits across socioeconomic groups was estimated using
  concentration indices. Health benefits from three types of formal providers were
  analysed (public, private and NGO providers), separated into rural and urban populations.
  Decomposition of concentration indices into types of providers quantified the relative
  contribution of providers to the overall distribution of benefits across socioeconomic
  groups. Eventually, the distribution of benefits was compared to the distribution
  of healthcare need (proxied by 'self-reported illness and symptoms') across socioeconomic
  groups. Data from the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2010 and WHO-CHOICE
  were used. Results An overall pro-rich distribution of healthcare benefits was observed
  (CI = 0.229, t -value = 9.50). Healthcare benefits from private providers (CI =
  0.237, t -value = 9.44) largely favoured the richer socioeconomic groups. Little
  evidence of inequity in benefits was found in public (CI = 0.044, t -value = 2.98)
  and NGO (CI = 0.095, t -value = 0.54) providers. Private providers contributed by
  95.9% to overall inequity. The poorest socioeconomic group with 21.8% of the need
  for healthcare received only 12.7% of the benefits, while the richest group with
  18.0% of the need accounted for 32.8% of the health benefits. Conclusion Overall
  healthcare benefits in Bangladesh were pro-rich, particularly because of health
  benefits from private providers. Public providers were observed to contribute relatively
  slightly to inequity. The poorest (richest) people with largest (least) need for
  healthcare actually received lower (higher) benefits. When working to achieve Universal
  Health Coverage in Bangladesh, particular consideration should be given to ensuring
  that private sector care is more equitable.
