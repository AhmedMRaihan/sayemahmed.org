abstract: BACKGROUND Universal health coverage implies that people obtain the health
  services they need without experiencing financial hardship. While the factors contributing
  to catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) among households are well understood, few
  studies have examined this relationship in the context of environmentally vulnerable
  regions, such as tropical deltas. This study aims to examine the disparities in
  the prevalence of CHE and impoverishment due to out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare payments
  in the Mekong Delta in comparison with rest of Vietnam. It also intends to investigate
  the associations between economic and environmental shocks, CHE and the impoverishment
  from healthcare payments. METHODS Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards
  Survey 2012, the prevalence of CHE was estimated from the fraction of healthcare
  costs in relation to household consumption expenditure. The poverty headcount was
  estimated using the total household consumption expenditure considering both with
  and without OOP expenditure for healthcare in comparison with the national poverty-line.
  Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the associations
  between geography, health systems, environmental and demographic variables and OOP
  healthcare expenditure related CHE, and impoverishment respectively. RESULTS Both
  the level of OOP household healthcare expenditure and the proportion of households
  suffering from impoverishment as the result of such payments were higher in the
  Mekong Delta region compared to rest of Vietnam. Although the results from the multiple
  regression analysis showed that households in the Mekong Delta region were significantly
  less likely to suffer from CHE, they were significantly more likely to be impoverished
  due to OOP healthcare expenditure. While health insurance membership did not have
  a significant effect on either outcomes, households that faced an economic or an
  environmental shock in past 5 years were considerably more likely to suffer from
  CHE and impoverishment from OOP healthcare payments. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest
  that the financial protection capacity of health insurance schemes in Vietnam should
  be improved and expanded to reduce impoverishment as the result of OOP healthcare
  payments, particularly in the Mekong Delta region. Additional investments in disaster
  preparedness strategies can further help to reduce the financial burden of households
  in this environmentally vulnerable region.
