abstract: "Background: The assessment of hospital efficiency is attracting interest\
  \ worldwide, particularly in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The objective\
  \ of this study was to review the literature on public hospital efficiency and synthesise\
  \ the findings in GCC countries and comparable settings. Methods: We systematically\
  \ searched six scientific databases, references and grey literature for studies\
  \ that measured the efficiency of public hospitals in appropriate countries, and\
  \ followed PRISMA guidelines to present the results. We summarised the included\
  \ studies in terms of samples, methods/technologies and findings, then assessed\
  \ their quality. We meta-analysed the efficiency estimates using Spearman's rank\
  \ correlations and logistic regression, to examine the internal validity of the\
  \ findings. Results: We identified and meta-analysed 22 of 1128 studies. Four studies\
  \ were conducted in GCC nations, 18 came from Iran and Turkey. The pooled technical-efficiency\
  \ (TE) was 0.792 (SE Â± 0.03). There were considerable variations in model specification,\
  \ analysis orientation and variables used in the studies, which influenced efficiency\
  \ estimates. The studies lacked some elements required in quality appraisal, achieving\
  \ an average of 73%. Meta-analysis showed negative correlations between sample size\
  \ and efficiency scores; the odd ratio was 0.081 (CI 0.005: 1.300; P value = 0.07)\
  \ at 10% risk level. The choice of model orientation was significantly influenced\
  \ (82%) by the studied countries' income categories, which was compatible with the\
  \ strategic plans of these countries. Conclusions: The studies showed methodological\
  \ and qualitative deficiencies that limited their credibility. Our review suggested\
  \ that methodology and assumption choices have a substantial impact on efficiency\
  \ measurements. Given the GCC countries' strategic plans and resource allocations,\
  \ these nations need further efficiency research using high-quality data, different\
  \ orientations and developed models. This will establish an evidence-based knowledge\
  \ base appropriate for use in public hospital assessments, policy- and decision-making\
  \ and the assurance of value for money."
