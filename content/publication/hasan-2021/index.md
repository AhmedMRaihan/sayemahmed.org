abstract: BACKGROUND Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among
  under-five children in Bangladesh. Hospitalization for diarrhea can pose a significant
  burden on households and health systems. The aim of this study was to estimate the
  cost of illness due to diarrhea from the healthcare facility, caregiver, and societal
  perspectives in Bangladesh. METHOD A cross-sectional study with an ingredient-based
  costing approach was conducted in 48 healthcare facilities in Bangladesh. In total,
  899 caregivers of under-five children with diarrhea were interviewed face-to-face
  between August 2017 and May 2018, followed up over phone after 7-14 days of discharge,
  to capture all expenses and time costs related to the entire episode of diarrhea.
  RESULTS The average cost per episode for caregivers was US$62, with $29 direct and
  $34 indirect costs. From the societal perspective, average cost per episode of diarrhea
  was $71. In 2018, an estimated $79 million of economic costs were incurred for treating
  diarrhea in Bangladesh. Using 10% of income as threshold, over 46% of interviewed
  households faced catastrophic expenditure from diarrheal disease. CONCLUSION The
  economic costs incurred by caregivers for treating per-episode of diarrhea was around
  4% of the annual national gross domestic product per-capita. Investment in vaccination
  can help to reduce the prevalence of diarrheal diseases and avert this public health
  burden.
