abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The reliance on out-of-pocket payments for health services
  leads to a catastrophic burden for many households in Bangladesh. The World Health
  Organization suggests that risk-pooling mechanisms should be used for financing
  healthcare. Like many low-income countries (LIC), a large share of employment in
  Bangladesh is in the informal sector (88%). Inclusion of these workers in health
  insurance is a big challenge. Among other barriers, the \"literacy gap\" for health
  insurance\" is a reason for the low insurance uptake in Bangladesh. The aim of this
  study is, therefore, to assess the impact of an educational intervention on willingness-to-pay
  (WTP) for health insurance among informal sector workers in urban Bangladesh. METHOD:
  An educational intervention on occupational solidarity and health insurance is offered
  to groups of informal workers. Educational sessions take place once a week (3-4
  hours) during three subsequent weeks for each occupational group. For assessing
  the impact of the educational intervention, WTP for joining health insurance using
  occupational solidarity between workers in \"pre- and post-treatment\" periods as
  well as between \"control and treatment\" groups were compared. Multiple-regression
  analysis is applied for predicting WTP by educational intervention, while controlling
  for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. RESULTS: The coefficient of variation
  (CoV) of the WTP is estimated in control and treatment groups and expected to be
  lower in the latter. The WTP for health insurance is higher (33.8%) among workers
  who joined the educational intervention in comparison with those who did not (control
  group). CoV of WTP is found to be generally lower in post-treatment period and in
  treatment group compared to pre-treatment period and control group respectively.
  CONCLUSION: Educational interventions can be used for increasing demand for health
  insurance scheme using occupational solidarity among informal sector workers.'
