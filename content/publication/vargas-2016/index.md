abstract: 'A strong health financing system will be an important priority as Bangladesh
  seeks to meet theexpectations of its population and embrace its future as a middle-income
  country. The objective of this report is to present policymakers with a foundation
  for an informed discussionabout government health spending and future health financing
  options in Bangladesh. It analyzesalternative sources of additional health financing
  and their potential contribution to higher spending in the sector. The findings
  will be relevant to both the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Ministry of Health and
  Family Welfare (MoHFW) and can inform a dialogue between the two Ministries as the
  government seeks a way forward.Fiscal space for health is a particularly important
  policy challenge for Bangladesh because it currently has one of the lowest levels
  of government health spending in the world.Fiscal space for health refers to the
  availability of budgetary room that would allow a government to increase health
  spending without jeopardizing the sustainability of its fiscal position. In general
  there are five potential sources of fiscal space: (1) economic growth which translates
  into more overall government revenues and, in turn, a larger health budget; (2)
  a reprioritization within the budget in favor of health, resulting in higher expenditures;
  (3) increased overseas development assistance (ODA) for health; (4) an increase
  in health-specific resources, such as earmarked taxation or insurance contributions;
  and (5) greater efficiency in the use of existing health budget resources such that
  additional resources become available for new spending.The report also presents
  illustrative scenarios to show the potential impact that these channels can have
  on fiscal space for health in Bangladesh going forward. In summary, financing health
  in Bangladesh over the short to medium term will require a combination of existing
  and additional domestic resources that result from economic growth, improved tax
  collection, and most significantly a moderate re-prioritization of the budget in
  favor of the health sector. A longer-term agenda will relate to the possibility
  of generating additional resources through individual contributions starting with
  the formal employed sector, if that is the path chosen.'
