abstract: 'When facing adverse health from noncommunicable disease (NCD), households adopt coping strategies that may further enforce poverty traps. This study looks at coping after an adult NCD death in rural Bangladesh. Compared with similar households without NCD deaths, households with NCD deaths were more likely to reduce basic expenditure and to have decreased social safety net transfers. Household composition changes showed that there was demographic coping for prime age deaths through the addition of more women. The evidence for coping responses from NCDs in low- and middle-income countries may inform policy options such as social protection to address health-related impoverishment.'
