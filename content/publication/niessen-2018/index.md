abstract: 'Summary Five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set targets that relate
  to the reduction of health inequalities nationally and worldwide. These targets
  are poverty reduction, health and wellbeing for all, equitable education, gender
  equality, and reduction of inequalities within and between countries. The interaction
  between inequalities and health is complex: better economic and educational outcomes
  for households enhance health, low socioeconomic status leads to chronic ill health,
  and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) reduce income status of households. NCDs account
  for most causes of early death and disability worldwide, so it is alarming that
  strong scientific evidence suggests an increase in the clustering of non-communicable
  conditions with low socioeconomic status in low-income and middle-income countries
  since 2000, as previously seen in high-income settings. These conditions include
  tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes. Strong evidence from 283
  studies overwhelmingly supports a positive association between low-income, low socioeconomic
  status, or low educational status and NCDs. The associations have been differentiated
  by sex in only four studies. Health is a key driver in the SDGs, and reduction of
  health inequalities and NCDs should become key in the promotion of the overall SDG
  agenda. A sustained reduction of general inequalities in income status, education,
  and gender within and between countries would enhance worldwide equality in health.
  To end poverty through elimination of its causes, NCD programmes should be included
  in the development agenda. National programmes should mitigate social and health
  shocks to protect the poor from events that worsen their frail socioeconomic condition
  and health status. Programmes related to universal health coverage of NCDs should
  specifically target susceptible populations, such as elderly people, who are most
  at risk. Growing inequalities in access to resources for prevention and treatment
  need to be addressed through improved international regulations across jurisdictions
  that eliminate the legal and practical barriers in the implementation of non-communicable
  disease control.'
