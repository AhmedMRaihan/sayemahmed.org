abstract: 'In low-income countries, a growing proportion of the disease burden is
  attributable to non- communicable diseases (NCDs). There is little knowledge, however,
  of their impact on wealth, human capital, economic growth or household poverty.
  This article estimates the risk of being poor after an NCD death in the rural, low-income
  area of Matlab, Bangladesh. In a matched cohort study, we estimated the 2-year relative
  risk (RR) of being poor in Matlab households with an NCD death in 2010. Three separate
  measures of household economic status were used as outcomes: an asset-based index,
  self-rated household economic condition and total household landholding. Several
  estimation methods were used including contingency tables, log-binomial regression
  and regression standardization and machine learning. Households with an NCD death
  had a large and significant risk of being poor. The unadjusted RR of being poor
  after death was 1.19, 1.14 and 1.10 for the asset quintile, self-rated condition
  and landholding outcomes. Adjusting for household and individual level independent
  variables with log-binomial regression gave RRs of 1.19 [standard error (SE) 0.09],
  1.16 (SE 0.07) and 1.14 (SE 0.06), which were found to be exactly the same using
  regression standardization (SE: 0.09, 0.05, 0.03). Machine learning-based standardization
  produced slightly smaller RRs though still in the same order of magnitude. The findings
  show that efforts to address the burden of NCD may also combat household poverty
  and provide a return beyond improved health. Future work should attempt to disentangle
  the mechanisms through which economic impacts from an NCD death occur.Key MessagesDespite
  a growing global awareness of the emerging burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
  in low and middle-income countries, there is little evidence of the microeconomic
  household impact.In rural Bangladesh, information from a demographic surveillance
  site allows the identification of households with NCD deaths and the use of multiple
  economic outcomes in a longitudinal cohort analysis.We find that the presence of
  an NCD death leads to an increased 2-year risk that households are poor according
  to asset score, self-report as poor or are land-poor.'
