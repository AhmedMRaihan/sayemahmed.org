abstract: 'Objective:
  We estimated the effect of an employer-sponsored health insurance
  (ESHI) scheme on healthcare utilisation of medically trained providers and reduction
  of out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure among ready-made garment (RMG) workers. 
  
  Design:
  We used a case-control study design with cross-sectional preintervention and postintervention
  surveys. 
  Settings:
  The study was conducted among workers of seven purposively selected
  RMG factories in Shafipur, Gazipur in Bangladesh. Participants In total, 1924 RMG
  workers (480 from the insured and 482 from the uninsured, in each period) were surveyed
  from insured and uninsured RMG factories, respectively, in the preintervention (October
  2013) and postintervention (April 2015) period. Interventions We tested the effect
  of a pilot ESHI scheme which was implemented for 1 year. Outcome measures The outcome
  measures were utilisation of medically trained providers and reduction of OOP expenditure
  among RMG workers. We estimated difference-in-difference (DiD) and applied two-part
  regression model to measure the association between healthcare utilisation, OOP
  payments and ESHI scheme membership while controlling for the socioeconomic characteristics
  of workers. Results The ESHI scheme increased healthcare utilisation of medically
  trained providers by 26.1% (DiD=26.1; ptextless0.01) among insured workers compared
  with uninsured workers. While accounting for covariates, the effect on utilisation
  significantly reduced to 18.4% (ptextless0.05). The DiD estimate showed that OOP
  expenditure among insured workers decreased by -3700 Bangladeshi taka and -1100
  Bangladeshi taka compared with uninsured workers when using healthcare services
  from medically trained providers or all provider respectively, although not significant.
  The multiple two-part models also reported similar results. Conclusion The ESHI
  scheme significantly increased utilisation of medically trained providers among
  RMG workers. However, it has no significant effect on OOP expenditure. It can be
  recommended that an educational intervention be provided to RMG workers to improve
  their healthcare-seeking behaviours and increase their utilisation of ESHI-designated
  healthcare providers while keeping OOP payments low.'
