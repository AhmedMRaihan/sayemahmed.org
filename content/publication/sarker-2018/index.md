abstract: "Background: Community-based health insurance is recognized as a promising\
  \ tool for health system improvement for low-income people that improves the health\
  \ status of enrolees and enhances productivity and labor supply. The experience\
  \ and opinion of the clients who utilized health services through the insurance\
  \ scheme are important for improving healthcare services, shaping health policies\
  \ and providing feedback on the quality, availability, and responsiveness of healthcare\
  \ services. However, studies focusing on clients' satisfaction provided by the health\
  \ insurance scheme are still limited globally. Objective: To address this knowledge\
  \ gap, this current study attempted to measure the degree of clients' satisfaction\
  \ towards healthcare services and insurance scheme, based on their experience of\
  \ health care which will serve the future reference point to implement potential\
  \ quality improvement initiatives of community-based health insurance program. Methods:\
  \ A cross-sectional household survey was conducted within the catchment area of\
  \ a community-based health insurance pilot program named Labor Association for Social\
  \ Protection (LASP) during April–June 2014 to compare the evaluation of healthcare\
  \ services provided by LASP scheme. In the descriptive analyses, the characteristics\
  \ of the study participants were presented regarding frequency and the percentages\
  \ with 95% confidence interval. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted between\
  \ the satisfaction score of each indicator and overall satisfaction score; multivariate\
  \ linear regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with overall\
  \ health scheme satisfaction. Results: The overall satisfaction mean score was 4.17\
  \ ± 0.04 (95% CI: 4.08–4.26) out of 5.00. The most satisfied domains were related\
  \ to the diagnostic services (4.46 ± 0.98), explanation about the prescribed medicine\
  \ (4.23 ± 0.81), the surrounding environment of healthcare facility (4.21 ± 0.70)\
  \ and the behavior of health personnel toward clients (4.18 ± 0.73). Conclusions:\
  \ Our study observed that the overall satisfaction level towards health services\
  \ is quite favorable, but satisfaction scores can still be improved. These findings\
  \ could contribute towards developing and designing the healthcare services packages\
  \ of community-based health scheme which is in line with the health care financing\
  \ strategy of Bangladesh as well as the recommendation of the World Health Organization\
  \ for developing social health insurance as part of path to Universal Health Coverage."
