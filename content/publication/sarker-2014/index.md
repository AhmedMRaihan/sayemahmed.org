abstract: The impact of age and sex on health care expenditure has recently become
  one of the major concerns in many developing countries like Bangladesh. Age and
  sex differences in the use of health care services can be substantial at several
  stages of life which are reflected in overall healthcare expenditure.We examined
  the impact of age and sex of the population on overall healthcare expenditure of
  households in Bangladesh.A total of 10,705 populations who spent for receiving any
  type of healthcare services were analyzed from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure
  Survey data, 2010. Sex and age group were considered as childhood (0-19), young
  adult (20-39), middle-aged adult (40-64), senior aged (65-84) and old senior aged
  (84+) for the entire analysis. Total healthcare expenditure was derived by considering
  direct cost such as physician's fee, cost of medicine, diagnostic, transportation,
  tips and informal payment etc. Indirect and intangible cost was not considered in
  the analysis.The study found that overall health care expenditure of male (US$ 11.5)
  is higher than female (US$ 11.2) while this is higher for female (US$ 14.2) than
  male (US$ 11.3) in the reproductive age. The highest health expenditure was observed
  in male (US$ 69.7) of age 65-69 years and in female (US$ 23.4) of age 75-79 years.
  The cost for hospitalization was significantly higher (US $23.7) for female than
  male (US$ 21.1). Overall health expenditure was observed to be significantly higher
  in elderly than younger people.These findings provide an experimental framework
  for the continuing inquiry of equity in the allocation of health care expenditure
  between male and female at different age, which suggest current health care system
  in Bangladesh place a significant financial strain on the elderly population.
