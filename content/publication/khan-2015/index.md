abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term changes linking chronic diseases
  and poverty in low-income countries such as Bangladesh. This study examines how
  chronic disease mortality rates change across socioeconomic groups over time in
  Bangladesh, and whether such mortality is associated with households falling into
  poverty. METHODS: Age-sex standardized chronic diseases mortality rates were estimated
  across socioeconomic groups in 1982, 1996 and 2005, using data from the health and
  demographic surveillance system in Matlab, Bangladesh. Changes in households falling
  below a poverty threshold after a chronic disease death were estimated between 1982-96
  and 1996-2005. RESULTS: Age-sex standardized chronic disease mortality rates rose
  from 646 per 100 000 population in 1982 to 670 in 2005. Mortality rates were higher
  in wealthier compared with poorer households in 1982 [Concentration Index = 0.037;
  95% confidence interval (CI): 0.002, 0.072], but switched direction in 1996 (Concentration
  Index = -0.007; 95% CI: -0.023, 0.009), with an even higher concentration in the
  poor by 2005 (Concentration Index = -0.047; 95% CI: -0.061, -0.033). Between 1982-96
  and 1996-2005, the highest chronic disease mortality rates were found among those
  households that fell below the poverty line. Households that had a chronic disease
  death in 1982 were 1.33 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.70) times more likely to fall below the
  poverty line in 1996 compared with households that did not. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic
  disease mortality is a growing proportion of the disease burden in Bangladesh, with
  poorer households being more affected over time periods, leading to future household
  poverty.'
