abstract: The Sustainable Development Goals target to achieve Universal Health Coverage
  (UHC), including financial risk protection (FRP) among other dimensions. There are
  four indicators of FRP, namely incidence of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE),
  mean positive catastrophic overshoot, incidence of impoverishment and increase in
  the depth of poverty occur for high out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare spending. OOP
  spending is the major payment strategy for healthcare in most low-and-middle-income
  countries, such as Bangladesh. Large and unpredictable health payments can expose
  households to substantial financial risk and, at their most extreme, can result
  in poverty. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of OOP spending on
  CHE and poverty, i.e. status of FRP for UHC in Bangladesh. A nationally representative
  Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2010 was used to determine household consumption
  expenditure and health-related spending in the last 30 days. Mean CHE headcount
  and its concentration indices (CI) were calculated. The propensity of facing CHE
  for households was predicted by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The
  poverty headcount was estimated using 'total household consumption expenditure'
  and such expenditure without OOP payments for health in comparison with the poverty-line
  measured by cost of basic need. In absolute values, a pro-rich distribution of OOP
  payment for healthcare was found in urban and rural Bangladesh. At the 10%-threshold
  level, in total 14.2% of households faced CHE with 1.9% overshoot. 16.5% of the
  poorest and 9.2% of the richest households faced CHE. An overall pro-poor distribution
  was found for CHE (CI = -0.064) in both urban and rural households, while the former
  had higher CHE incidences. The poverty headcount increased by 3.5% (5.1 million
  individuals) due to OOP payments. Reliance on OOP payments for healthcare in Bangladesh
  should be reduced for poverty alleviation in urban and rural Bangladesh in order
  to secure FRP for UHC.
