abstract: 'In response to a request from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), this provider
focused cost analysis of the Bangladesh Essential Health Service Package (ESP) was conducted
during January to September 2017 by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research,
Bangladesh (icddr,b) with the funding support from WHO and technical assistance from the
USAID-funded Health Finance & Governance (HFG) project. The MOHFW updated the ESP in
2016 for its fourth Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Programme (HNPSP, 2016-22). The
primary objective of this analysis was to estimate the costs of the updated Bangladesh ESP for
2016 to 2022 by interventions and delivery channels in public sector. The results of the study are
expected to be used in advocacy for domestic resources required to implement the updated ESP
during the target years.
Approach:
The One Health Tool (OHT) was used to project resource needs and costs of providing the
updated ESP. OHT is used globally to support medium- to long-term (3-10 years) strategic
planning in the health sector, and has been used to inform strategic planning processes in over 30
low and middle income countries. It provides a unified framework to strengthen integrated
planning by supporting the planning, costing, and budgeting of health sector priorities, including
health system strengthening strategies.
The study team adopted a collaborative and consultative approach to engage all partners in the
costing process. Key partners included: Health Economics Unit, Programme Management and
Monitoring Unit (PMMU), Planning Wing of MOHFW, Directorate General of Health Services
(DGHS), Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP) of the MOHFW, Urban Primary Health
Care Service Delivery Programme under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development, Institute of Health Economics Dhaka University, and representatives from HFG and
WHO.
A seven-member National OHT Resource Pool was formed to develop expertise in cost analysis
using the OHT. In addition to the resource pool, an international OHT consultant and an external
reviewer from HFG, as well as two external reviewers from WHO, assisted the icddr,b team.
Methodology:
The team identified the scope of investments required for ESP implementation, including the costs
of services and health system (human resources, infrastructure, and logistics) required to enable
this implementation in the public sector health facilities.
The team applied an ingredients-based costing method using OHT. This costing approach was used
to cost all ESP services except those for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and neglected tropical
diseases (which were costed using aggregate budget line items obtained from program
implementers). The tool was customized for the updated Bangladesh ESP, and members of the
OHT resource pool and the study team jointly reviewed the default data in the OHT. The team
collected secondary data (e.g., coverage data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health
Survey, etc.), followed by primary data (e.g., required drugs/supplies and provider time for certain
interventions for which there were no treatment guidelines) from purposively selected ESP
delivery facilities under the MOHFW in Jhenaidah (Kotchandpur and Harinakunda UHCs) and
Dhaka North City Corporation (Urban PHC Clinic [UPHCC] and Comprehensive Reproductive
Health Care Centre [CRHCC]) under the MOLGRD.

The team collected data through physical inventories and key informant interviews with officials
and service providers at the selected public facilities, national and sub-national levels. An exit
survey at Jhenaidah District Hospital was also conducted to estimate the proportion of patients
receiving the ESP (i.e., the percentage of patients from upazila level and urban areas accessing ESP
care at district hospitals). The data input into the OHT to estimate the cost of ESP services was
based on current practice, standard treatment protocols, assumptions, and coverage levels in 2016
(see Appendix B). The team also derived assumptions from key informant interviews with qualified
physicians/service providers for interventions that were not yet available but planned for the
future.
Data inputs used for ESP delivery in 2016 (base year) included those inputs directly associated
with ESP service delivery (e.g., medicines, supplies, and health personnel time), in addition to the
health system inputs necessary to support these services (e.g., human resources, infrastructure,
equipment, logistics etc.). These base year data inputs were also used for 2017-2022 (target years)
including any additional health system costs (e.g., construction of new health facilities, purchase of
new equipment, vehicle etc.) and program activity costs (e.g., human resource training, supervision,
etc.). These were identified, quantified, and valued in local currency (Bangladesh Taka, hereafter
referred to as BDT) by delivery channels to estimate the total cost of the ESP in public sector. The
quantity and unit price of these inputs were organized into the related OHT modules (health
services or health system module). The unit price of material inputs was collected from
government and market sources. Staff time, drugs and supplies required per intervention was
collected from physicians/supervisors expert opinion. Service coverage data for target years
(2017-2022) was derived from the respective Operational Plan and Programme Implementation
Plan. Coverage data for the base year (2016) was gathered through document review, using for
example, the Health Bulletin, Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), Bangladesh
Health and Morbidity Status survey, Urban Health survey, FP Management Information System
(MIS), and other sources (see references). Consultative meetings with government program
officials and policy planners were held on monthly basis to validate/cross-check data collected
from the field settings.
Using treatment input data (drugs, tests, supplies, & labor cost), the cost per intervention or
service per person (unit cost) at public sector delivery channels were estimated for each of the
listed ESP interventions. As the cost per service per person varied by delivery channel, a weighted
average cost for each intervention was calculated.
In 2016, coverage of ESP services varied from 2.2% (for female sterilization) to 82.5% (for BCG
vaccination) by delivery channel, with an estimated weighted average of 20.4% coverage in the
public sector. This is consistent with a 2015 Bangladesh national health accounts (BNHA) estimate
that approximately 23% of the total healthcare expenditures are borne through the public sector.
As ESP services are rolled out from 2017-2022, the estimated weighted average ESP coverage is
expected to increase in public facilities to approximately 33% by 2022. The study team calculated
an average cost per beneficiary by dividing the total cost of providing ESP in public sector by the
population that actually received ESP services during the base year (using the estimated weighted
average coverage in 2016) and is expected to receive ESP in the target years (using the estimated
weighted average coverage in 2022). For local and international comparisons, the public per capita
cost was estimated dividing the total cost of providing the ESP by Bangladesh’s total population
irrespective of their coverage status.

Key Findings:
Based on the 2016 data inputs (i.e., coverage levels, necessary medicines/supplies and labor for
interventions, health system costs, etc.), the estimated total cost of the ESP in the public sector in
2016 was BDT 76,195 million. This higher estimated cost of ESP services in 2016 is due to several
factors, including the costing approach used, which involved costing ESP interventions as per
current practice, as well as using standard protocols and assumptions for those interventions
(primarily non-communicable diseases services including hypertension, diabetes, etc.) which were
supposed to be available through the ESP but were not found to be fully operational at the time of
data collection. The cost of ESP services is expected to increase to BDT 103,194 million in 2022,
based on planned increase in service coverage and resources committed for 2017-2022 in
Operational Plans, the cost of current and new services, standard protocols and assumptions.
The study team calculated an “average cost per beneficiary (or service user)” in 2016 in public
facilities as approximately BDT 2349 (29.8 USD)- which would be reduced to BDT 1805 (22.4
USD) in 2022 due to planned increase in coverage and expected efficiency gain through using fixed
assets (Appendix E).This figure does not include inflation, but includes health system costs, it was
calculated from the specific ESP interventions that were costed for that particular year at the
specified coverage level, and it does not represent the average cost for a single client – who would
typically need a mix of these services.

The study team used the OHT to calculate the unit costs of 132 interventions across 10 delivery
channels in the public sector. These recurrent costs represent the cost per service per person
(including drugs, supplies, and labor cost) for each intervention provided through each delivery
channel in public sector. As expected, these costs vary significantly by type of service and delivery
channel for difference in service providers and infrastructure. The team therefore; calculated a
weighted average cost for each intervention to provide an estimate of the approximate cost of ESP
interventions without focusing on the channel at which it is delivered, which is anticipated to be
used for overall planning purposes (Appendix C).

The public per capita cost for the ESP was BDT 475 (6.1 USD) in the base year 2016, increasing
over the target years to BDT 596 (7.4 USD) in 2022. This per capita cost has been estimated for
local and international comparison. In 2001, Tim Ensor et al. showed that the public per capita cost
of ESP for 2001 was BDT 115 (inflation adjusted for 2016). Our per capita estimate for 2016 was
four times higher than 2001 estimate. However; this increase in per capita cost is attributable to
increase in number of services e.g. non-communicable diseases (NCD) under updated ESP and its
coverage.

ESP services at district hospitals and upazila health complexes (UHCs) accounted for the highest
proportion of total costs in 2016, a trend that continues from 2016 to 2022. This is attributed to
several things including that these facilities provide most ESP services, overall accessibility to
services at these facilities, the size of the facilities and the required supplies and staffing. MNCAH
services were the most costly at UHCs, where the costs of child health and maternal health
ranked the highest. Compared to other service delivery channels in public sector, NCD services
were the greatest cost contributors at district hospitals, where most NCD services listed under
the updated ESP are provided. The cost of ESP services at community clinic level was greater than
in urban primary health care clinics in 2016. This is due to the greater number of community clinics
and the larger volume of patients receiving ESP services compared to urban primary health care
clinics

RECOMMENDATIONS
* These results provide an estimate of the annual investment required for delivering ESP
effectively. Policy planners may consider these estimates and use them to advocate for
increased funding for health to match the costs.
* The National OHT Resource Pool should work under an institutional framework of the
MOHFW to conduct additional costing exercises, including using standard treatment
protocols for all services; these scenarios will be useful for the mid-term review of the 4th
HPNSP and for planning of the next sector program. Using these estimates for future
development of ESP:
* These estimates should be used by policymakers for further development of a feasible and
efficient ESP package and for setting target of the coverage through public delivery channels
for next sector programme and also to increase fiscal space for health.
* Future ESP cost estimates should also use standard protocols (normative costs) for all
interventions, or WHO guidelines if Bangladesh-specific guidelines are not available, to
identify the gap between current practice and protocols, and to provide planners with
evidence to advocate for increase funding for the provision of quality ESP services across all
relevant delivery channels.
* As the country moves towards UHC by 2030, future analyses should look at the cost of
current and projected coverage of ESP by both public and private sector and cost for service
delivery by level of care(primary, secondary and tertiary) . That exercise will help the
government to plan and extend ESP coverage by both sector in a coordinated approach.
* Further studies should be conducted based on these cost estimates to generate evidence for
gaining efficiency and promoting equity in the health sector.'
