abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The cost of behavior change communication (BCC) interventions
  has not been rigorously studied in Bangladesh. This study was conducted to assess
  the implementation costs of a BCC intervention in a maternal, neonatal and child
  health program (Manoshi) run by BRAC, which has been operating in the urban slums
  of Dhaka since 2007. The study estimates the costs of BCC tools per exposure among
  the different types of BCC channels: face-to-face, group counseling, and mass media.
  METHODS: The study was conducted from November 2010 to April 2011 in the Dhaka urban
  slum area. A micro-costing approach was applied using primary and secondary data
  sources to estimate the cost of BCC tools. Primary data were collected through interviews
  with service-providers and managers from the Manoshi program, observations of group
  counseling, and mass media events. RESULTS: Per exposure, the cost of face-to-face
  counseling was found to be 3.08 BDT during pregnancy detection, 3.11 BDT during
  pregnancy confirmation, 12.42 BDT during antenatal care, 18.96 BDT during delivery
  care and 22.65 BDT during post-natal care. The cost per exposure of group counseling
  was 22.71 BDT (95 % CI 21.30-24.87) for Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) meetings,
  14.25 BDT (95% CI 12.37-16.12) for Women Support Group meetings, 17.83 BDT (95%
  CI 14.90-20.77) for MNCH committee meetings and 6.62 BDT (95% CI 5.99-7.26) for
  spouse forum meetings. We found the cost per exposure for mass media interventions
  was 9.54 BDT (95% CI 7.30-12.53) for folk songs, 26.39 BDT (95% CI 23.26-32.56)
  for street dramas, 0.39 BDT for TV-broadcasting and 7.87 BDT for billboards. Considering
  all components reaching the target audience under each broader type of channel,
  the total cost per exposure was found to be 60.22 BDT (0.82 USD) for face-to-face
  counseling, 61.40 BDT (0.82 USD) for group counseling and 44.19 BDT (0.61 USD) for
  mass media. CONCLUSIONS: The total cost for group counseling was the highest per
  exposure, followed by face-to-face counseling and mass media. The cost per exposure
  varied substantially across BCC channels due to differences in cost drivers such
  as personnel, materials and refreshments. The cost per exposure can be valuable
  for planning and resource allocation related to the implementation of BCC interventions
  in low resource settings.'
