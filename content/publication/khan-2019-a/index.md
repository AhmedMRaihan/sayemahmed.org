abstract: BACKGROUND We aimed to estimate the effect of the community-based health
  insurance (CBHI) scheme on the magnitude of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for the
  healthcare of the informal workers and their dependents. The CBHI scheme was piloted
  through a cooperative of informal workers, which covered seven unions in Chandpur
  Sadar Upazila, Bangladesh. METHODS A quasi-experimental study was conducted using
  a case-comparison design. In total 1292 (646 insured and 646 uninsured) households
  were surveyed. Propensity score matching was done to minimize the observed baseline
  differences in the characteristics between the insured and uninsured groups. A two-part
  regression model was applied using both the probability of OOP spending and magnitude
  of such spending for healthcare in assessing the association with enrolment status
  in the CBHI scheme while controlling for other covariates. RESULTS The OOP payment
  was 6.4% (p textless 0.001) lower for medically trained provider (MTP) utilization
  among the insured compared with the uninsured. However, no significant difference
  was found in the OOP payments for healthcare utilization from all kind of providers,
  including the non-trained ones. CONCLUSIONS The CBHI scheme could reduce OOP payments
  while providing better quality healthcare through the increased use of MTPs, which
  consequently could push the country towards universal health coverage.
