abstract: 'OBJECTIVES The contingent valuation (CV) method elicits WTP for calculating
  the value of statistical life (VSL). CV approaches for assessing VSL are uncommon
  in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Between 2008 and 2018 only 44 articles
  utilized WTP in a health-related field and of these only 5 (11%) utilized CV to
  assess the WTP for a mortality risk reduction. We elicit WTP estimates and compute
  VSL using the CV method in Bangladesh. METHODS The pilot study was primarily aimed
  at developing best practice guidelines for CV studies in LMICs to get more robust
  WTP estimates. To this end, we explored three methodological a) Varying the name
  of the intervention, keeping all other characteristics constant; b) varying the
  effectiveness of the health intervention and c) offering an overnight period to
  think about the WTP scenario. The survey was administered 413 randomly selected
  participants. VSL was for a 1/3000 mortality risk reduction. RESULTS We had more
  males (54%) than females (46%) and the mean annual self-reported income was $5,683.36.
  Mean VSL is $11,339.70 with a median of $10,413. The ratio of child: adult WTP is
  approximately 1 by both gender and age category. The vaccine intervention had the
  largest amount of $0 WTP and protest responses (52% and 58% respectively). 93% of
  the participants were able to describe (teach-back) the vaccine effectiveness using
  their own family as an example. CONCLUSION Our study provides empirical evidence
  on how to better generate CV surveys to produce more robust WTP estimates.'
