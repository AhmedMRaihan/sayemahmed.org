abstract: OBJECTIVES The informal sector is the dominant area of employment and the
  economy for any developing country including Bangladesh. The cost of productivity
  loss due to absence from work or presenteeism with illness has rarely been examined
  in the Bangladesh context. This current study, therefore, attempted to examine the
  impact of ill health of informal sector workers on labor productivity, future earning,
  and healthcare-related expenditure. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional survey was conducted
  among three occupational groups of informal workers (rickshaw pullers, shopkeepers
  and restaurant workers) that were generally found in all urban areas in Bangladesh.
  A total of 557 informal workers were surveyed for this study. RESULTS Most of the
  respondents (57%) reported that they had been affected by some type of illness for
  the last six months. The overall average healthcare expenditure of informal workers
  was US$48.34, while restaurant workers expended more (US$53.61). Self reported sickness
  absenteeism was highest (50.37days) in the case of shop keepers, followed by rickshaw
  pullers (49.31 days), in the last six months. Considering the income loss due to
  illness in the past six months, the rickshaw pullers were exposed to the highest
  income loss (US$197.15), followed by the shop keepers (US$151.39). CONCLUSIONS Although
  the informal sector contributes the most to the economy of Bangladesh, the workers
  in this sector have hardly any financial protection. This study provides critical
  clues to providing financial and social protection to informal sector workers in
  Bangladesh.
