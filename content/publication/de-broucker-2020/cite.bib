 abstract = {Background: This study estimated the economic cost of treating measles in children under-5 in Bangladesh from the caregiver, government, and societal perspectives. Method: We conducted an incidence-based study using an ingredient-based approach. We surveyed the administrative staff and the healthcare professionals at the facilities, recording their estimates supported by administrative data from the healthcare perspective. We conducted 100 face-to-face caregiver interviews at discharge and phone interviews 7 to 14 days post-discharge to capture all expenses, including time costs related to measles. All costs are in 2018 USD (\$). Results: From a societal perspective, a hospitalized and ambulatory case of measles cost \$159 and \$18, respectively. On average, the government spent \$22 per hospitalized case of measles. At the same time, caregivers incurred \$131 and \$182 in economic costs, including \$48 and \$83 in out-of-pocket expenses in public and private not-for-profit facilities, respectively. Seventy-eight percent of the poorest caregivers faced catastrophic health expenditures compared to 21% of the richest. In 2018, 2263 cases of measles were confirmed, totaling \$348,073 in economic costs to Bangladeshi society, with \$121,842 in out-of-pocket payments for households. Conclusion: The resurgence of measles outbreaks is a substantial cost for society, requiring significant short-term public expenditures, putting households into a precarious financial situation. Improving vaccination coverage in areas where it is deficient (Sylhet division in our study) would likely alleviate most of this burden.},
