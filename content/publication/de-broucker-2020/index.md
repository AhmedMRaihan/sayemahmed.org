abstract: 'Background: This study estimated the economic cost of treating measles
  in children under-5 in Bangladesh from the caregiver, government, and societal perspectives.
  Method: We conducted an incidence-based study using an ingredient-based approach.
  We surveyed the administrative staff and the healthcare professionals at the facilities,
  recording their estimates supported by administrative data from the healthcare perspective.
  We conducted 100 face-to-face caregiver interviews at discharge and phone interviews
  7 to 14 days post-discharge to capture all expenses, including time costs related
  to measles. All costs are in 2018 USD ($). Results: From a societal perspective,
  a hospitalized and ambulatory case of measles cost $159 and $18, respectively. On
  average, the government spent $22 per hospitalized case of measles. At the same
  time, caregivers incurred $131 and $182 in economic costs, including $48 and $83
  in out-of-pocket expenses in public and private not-for-profit facilities, respectively.
  Seventy-eight percent of the poorest caregivers faced catastrophic health expenditures
  compared to 21% of the richest. In 2018, 2263 cases of measles were confirmed, totaling
  $348,073 in economic costs to Bangladeshi society, with $121,842 in out-of-pocket
  payments for households. Conclusion: The resurgence of measles outbreaks is a substantial
  cost for society, requiring significant short-term public expenditures, putting
  households into a precarious financial situation. Improving vaccination coverage
  in areas where it is deficient (Sylhet division in our study) would likely alleviate
  most of this burden.'
