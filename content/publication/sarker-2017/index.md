abstract: 'Background: Providing access to affordable health care for the informal
  sector remains a consid erable challenge for low income countries striving to make
  progress towards universal health coverage. The objective of the study is to identify
  the factors shaping the decision to enroll in a cooperative based health scheme
  for informal workers in Bangladesh and also help to identify the features of informal
  workers without health schemes and their likelihood of being insured. Methods: Data
  were derived from a cross-sectional in-house survey within the catchment area of
  a cooperative based health scheme in Bangladesh during Aprilâ€“June 2014, covering
  a total of 784 households (458 members and 326 non-members). Multivariate logistic
  regression model was used to identify factors associated with cooperative based
  health scheme and explanatory variables. Findings: This study found that a number
  of factors were significant determinants of health scheme participation including
  sex of household head, household composition, occupational category as well as involvement
  social financial safety net programs. Conclusion: Findings from this study can be
  suggestive for policy-makers interested in scaling up health insurance for informal
  workers in Bangladesh. Shared funding from this large informal sector can generate
  new resources for healthcare, which is in line with the healthcare financing strategy
  of Bangladesh as well as the recommendation of the World Health Organization for
  developing social health insurance as part of the path to Universal Health Coverage.'
