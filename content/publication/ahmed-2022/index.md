abstract: BACKGROUND Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for healthcare have been increasing
  steadily in Bangladesh, which deteriorates the financial risk protection of many
  households. METHODS We aimed to investigate the incidence of catastrophic health
  expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment from OOP payments and their determinants. We
  employed nationally representative Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016
  data with a sample of 46 076 households. A household that made OOP payments of textgreater10%
  of its total or 40% of its non-food expenditure was considered to be facing CHE.
  We estimated the impoverishment using both national and international poverty lines.
  Multiple logistic models were employed to identify the determinants of CHE and impoverishment.
  RESULTS The incidence of CHE was estimated as 24.6% and 10.9% using 10% of the total
  and 40% of non-food expenditure as thresholds, respectively, and these were concentrated
  among the poor. About 4.5% of the population (8.61 million) fell into poverty during
  2016. Utilization of private facilities, the presence of older people, chronic illness
  and geographical location were the main determinants of both CHE and impoverishment.
  CONCLUSION The financial hardship due to OOP payments was high and it should be
  reduced by regulating the private health sector and covering the care of older people
  and chronic illness by prepayment-financing mechanisms.
