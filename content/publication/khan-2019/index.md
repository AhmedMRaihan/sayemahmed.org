abstract: BACKGROUND Health and wellbeing as one of the Sustainable Development Goals
  requires all countries to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). That is, all
  people must have access to healthcare when needed at an affordable price. While
  several indices were developed recently to assess UHC status, these indices appeared
  to be difficult for practitioners to apply without statistical knowledge. OBJECTIVE
  This paper presents a transparent and step-by-step practical calculation method
  of such an index using Excel spreadsheets, applied to some Asian and African countries.
  We also decompose the contribution of socioeconomic groups to UHC index values.
  METHODS We utilized the well known UHC illustration (three-dimensional box, showing
  population coverage, service coverage and financial protection) to calculate the
  UHC index. We also broke down the index into socioeconomic groups. For validation,
  correlation coefficients between our index and other UHC indices were calculated
  and the relationship of our index with out-of-pocket (OOP) payments was estimated.
  RESULTS World Bank data from six Asian and 15 African countries on health-service
  coverage of people in five socioeconomic quintiles with financial protection were
  used to calculate our UHC index. Among the Asian countries, indices ranged between
  26.0% (Nepal) and 58.7% (Kazakhstan), while in African countries indices ranged
  between 8.9% (Chad) and 55.3% (Namibia). Decomposition of the UHC index showed a
  higher contribution to the index by richer socioeconomic groups. The correlation
  coefficients between our estimated UHC index values and those of others ranged between
  0.774 and 0.900. Our index reduced by 1.4% in response to a 1% increase in OOP payments.
  CONCLUSIONS This spreadsheet approach for calculating the UHC index appeared to
  be useful, where the interrelation of UHC dimensions was easily observed. Decomposition
  of the index could be useful for policy-makers to identify the subpopulations and
  health services with need for further interventions towards UHC achievement.
