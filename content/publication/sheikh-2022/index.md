abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Financial risk protection and equity are two fundamental components
  of the global commitment to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which mandates
  health system reform based on population needs, disease incidence, and economic
  burden to ensure that everyone has access to health services without any financial
  hardship. We estimated disease-specific incidences of catastrophic out-of-pocket
  health expenditure and distress financing to investigate progress toward UHC financial
  risk indicators and investigated inequalities in financial risk protection indicators
  by wealth quintiles. In addition, we explored the determinants of financial hardship
  indicators as a result of hospitalization costs. METHODS: In order to conduct this
  research, data were extracted from the latest Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure
  Survey (HIES), conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2016-2017. Financial
  hardship indicators in UHC were measured by catastrophic health expenditure and
  distress financing (sale/mortgage, borrowing, and family support). Concentration
  curves (CC) and indices (CI) were estimated to measure the pattern and severity
  of inequalities across socio-economic classes. Binary logistic regression models
  were used to assess the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure and distress
  financing. RESULTS: We found that about 26% of households incurred catastrophic
  health expenditure (CHE) and 58% faced distress financing on hospitalization in
  Bangladesh. The highest incidence of CHE was for cancer (50%), followed by liver
  diseases (49.2%), and paralysis (43.6%). The financial hardship indicators in terms
  of CHE (CI = -0.109) and distress financing (CI = -0.087) were more concentrated
  among low-income households. Hospital admission to private health facilities, non-communicable
  diseases, and the presence of chronic patients in households significantly increases
  the likelihood of higher UHC financial hardship indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The study
  findings strongly suggest the need for national-level social health security schemes
  with a particular focus on low-income households, since we identified greater inequalities
  between low- and high-income households in UHC financial hardship indicators. Regulating
  the private sector and implementing subsidized healthcare programmes for diseases
  with high treatment costs, such as cancer, heart disease, liver disease, and kidney
  disease are also expected to be effective to protect households from financial hardship.
  Finally, in order to reduce reliance on OOPE, the government should consider increasing
  its allocations to the health sector.'
