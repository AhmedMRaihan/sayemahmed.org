abstract: Young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are vulnerable
  to adverse effects of household microenvironments. The UN Sustainable Development
  Goals (SDGs)—specifically SDG 3 through 7—urge for a comprehensive multi-sector
  approach to achieve the 2030 goals. This study addresses gaps in understanding the
  health effects of household microenvironments in resource-poor settings. It studies
  associations of household microenvironment variables with episodes of acute respiratory
  infection (ARI) and diarrhoea as well as with stunting among under-fives using logistic
  regression. Comprehensive data from a nationally representative, cross-sectional
  demographic and health survey (DHS) in Uganda were analysed. We constructed and
  applied the multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI) and the three-dimensional
  women empowerment index in multi-variate regressions. The multidimensional energy
  poverty was associated with higher risk of ARI (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58).
  Social independence of women was associated with lower risk of ARI (OR= 0.91, 95%
  CI 0.84 to 0.98), diarrhoea (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99), and stunting (OR =
  0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92). Women's attitude against domestic violence was also
  significantly associated with episodes of ARI (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.93) and
  diarrhoea (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93) in children. Access to sanitation facilities
  was associated with lower risk of ARI (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.68), diarrhoea
  (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96), and stunting (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.86).
  Investments targeting synergies in integrated energy and water, sanitation and hygiene,
  and women empowerment programmes are likely to contribute to the reduction of the
  burden from early childhood illnesses. Research and development actions in LMICs
  should address and include multi-sector synergies.
