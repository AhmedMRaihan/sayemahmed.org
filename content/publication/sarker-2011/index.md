abstract: 'Costing is a major activity to define future service packages, plan payment methods
and measure the efficiency of the healthcare system. Maternal, neonatal and
child health (MNCH) services are of high importance in Bangladesh for meeting
MDGs (4 and 5). Several MNCH programs have been initiated in Bangladesh
and for some of them costs of services have been estimated. However, the cost of
behavior change communication (BCC), which is considered to be an integral part
of MNCH, has not been rigorously estimated in Bangladesh. Manoshi, a MNCH
program has been operating in urban slums of all city corporation areas by BRAC
since 2007. BCC key messages in Manoshi are delivered through thirteen subchannels
within three broader categories of channels.
The objective of this current study is to estimate the costs of BCC interventions
through 13 sub-channels separately. Pregnant women, their husband and
community people in the urban slums of Dhaka city, where Manoshi program is
being implemented, has been investigated.
The study is conducted during November, 2010 to April, 2011 in urban slums
of Dhaka City where Manoshi program is being implemented. Micro-costing
approach is utilized for calculating unit cost using primary and secondary
sources. Primary data is collected through interview of service-providers and
managers, observation of group counseling and mass media events and informal
group meeting. Information on magnitude of services provided is taken from
secondary sources. The cost of BCC tools per exposed is calculated.
BCC cost of FFC counseling is 2.94 BDT for pregnancy identification; 3.02 BDT
for pregnancy confirmation; 11.24 BDT for antenatal care; 18.10 BDT for delivery
care and 20.83 BDT for post natal care. Cost of group counseling is 22.31 BDT for
EDD meeting (women in later-stage pregnancy); 13.74 BDT for Women Support
Group meeting; 16.92 BDT for MNCH committee meeting; and 6.62 BDT for
spouse forum meeting. Mass media cost is 9.42 BDT for folksong; 26.27 BDT for
street drama, 0.40 BDT for TV-broadcasting and 2.61 BDT for billboard. We found
that BCC intervention channel, group counseling costs highest per exposed (59.63
BDT or US$ 0.82), followed by face-to-face counseling (56.13 BDT or US$ 0.77)
and mass media (38.83 BDT or US$ 0.53).
The costs per exposed through 13 BCC sub-channels are found. The cost per
exposed vary significantly across BCC intervention channels. Some of the inputs
appear as the cost drivers, namely, personnel, BCC materials and refreshment costs.
However, the major cost drivers vary across different channels and sub-channels.
The cost per exposed can be used for estimating total costs of BCC interventions in
ongoing and future projects, planning the cost containment and resource allocation
across different BCC sub-channels.'
