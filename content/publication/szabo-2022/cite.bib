 abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the association between remittances and food security in Bangladesh, controlling for other key factors. DESIGN The secondary data analysis was performed on the most recent (2016) nationally representative Household Income and Expenditure Survey. We used logistic regression models to measure the association between food security of the household and remittances received. The household food security was measured based on expenditure on food items and the energy intake of the household members. The key explanatory variables included the receipt of remittances by the household and household-level socio-economic characteristics. SETTING Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS Totally, 45 977 households across seven divisions of Bangladesh. RESULTS Findings suggested that remittances have a significant positive effect on food security. Further, the households with female heads were significantly more likely to be food insecure. The wealth status and geographical locations were significantly associated with food security status in Bangladesh. CONCLUSIONS The findings highlight the importance of considering remittance as one of the key factors, while stakeholders implement nutritional interventions in Bangladesh and other low-income settings. Future research should consider this as an important determinant while further examining food security in such settings.},
