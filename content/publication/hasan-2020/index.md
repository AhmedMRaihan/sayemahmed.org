  No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. OBJECTIVE: To
  examine the prevalence, correlates and sociodemographic inequalities of undiagnosed
  hypertension in Nepal. DESIGN: This study used cross-sectional 2016 Nepal Demographic
  and Health Survey (NDHS) data. Undiagnosed patients with hypertension were defined
  as an NDHS respondent who was diagnosed as hypertensive (systolic blood pressure
  ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) during the survey, but never
  took any prescribed anti-hypertensive medicine to lower/control blood pressure and
  was never identified as having hypertension by a health professional prior the survey.
  Multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed, and Concentration Index
  was measured.Nepal. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with hypertension. RESULTS: Among
  3334 patients with hypertension, 50.4% remained undiagnosed during the survey in
  Nepal. Adjusted model reveals that patients who were male, belonged to households
  other than the highest wealth quintile, and lived in province 4 and province 5 were
  at higher risk of remaining undiagnosed for hypertension. Patients who were ≥65
  years of age and were overweight/obese were at lower risk of remaining undiagnosed
  for hypertension. The poor-rich gap was 24.6 percentage points (Q1=64.1% vs Q5=39.6%)
  and poor:rich ratio was 1.6 (Q1/Q5=1.6) in the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension.
  Undiagnosed hypertension was disproportionately higher among lower socioeconomic
  status groups (Concentration Index, C=-0.18). Inequalities in the prevalence of
  undiagnosed hypertension further varied across other geographic locations, including
  place of residence, ecological zones and administrative provinces. CONCLUSIONS:
  Undiagnosed hypertension was highly prevalent in Nepal and there were substantial
  inequalities by sociodemographics and subnational levels. Increasing awareness,
  strengthening routine screening to diagnose hypertension at primary health service
  facilities and enactment of social health insurance policy may help Nepal to prevent
  and control this burden.'
